const AboutMe = {
    text: "I am a <b><i>fullstack</i></b> software developer in Greensboro, North Carolina, with a focus on front-end web development.  I have several years of experience building web applications using frameworks/libraries such as Angular.js, React.js, Vue.js and JQuery.  My favorite tools for building apps include:  VS Code for a development environment, webpack and npm scripts for building and bundling assets,  Postman for testing and documenting API endpoints, MongoDB or Couchbase for document (JSON) storage, MySQL or Postgres for relational databases, and AWS and IBM Bluemix for deployment and cloud services.  One of the things I love about being a software developer is the open source community and abundance of knowledge-sharing online and through social media.  I enjoy continually learning and trying new technologies, which often make a developer's job faster and easier, but it takes more than new tools and technologies to build great software.  I tend to be product-focused, and love the process of bringing an app idea to life, and believe a developer's main goal should be to produce software that users love.  Prior to my career as a software engineer, I worked for 11 years as a civil/environmental engineer.  I have an MS in Computer Science from UNC-Greensboro, as well as an MS in Civil Engineering from NC State University, and a BS in Biology from Duke University."
