const AboutMe = {
    text: "I am a <b><i>fullstack</i></b> software developer in Greensboro, North Carolina, with a focus on front-end web development.  I have several years of experience building web applications using frameworks/libraries such as <b><i>Angular.js</i></b>, <b><i>React.js</i></b>, <b><i>Vue.js</i></b> and <b><i>JQuery</i></b>.  My favorite tools for building apps include:  VS Code for a development environment, <b><i>webpack</i></b> and <b><i>npm scripts</i></b> for building and bundling assets,  <b><i>Postman</i></b> for testing and documenting API endpoints, <b><i>MongoDB</i></b> or <b><i>Couchbase</i></b> for document (JSON) storage, <b><i>PostgreSQL</i></b> or <b><i>MySQL</i></b> for relational databases, and <b><i>AWS</i></b> and <b><i>IBM Bluemix</i></b> for deployment and cloud services.  One of the things I love about being a software developer is the open-source community and abundance of knowledge-sharing online and through social media.  I enjoy continually learning and trying new technologies, which often make a developer's job faster and easier.  But, it takes more than new tools and technologies to build great software.  I tend to be product-focused, and love the process of bringing an app idea to life, and believe a developer's main goal should be to produce software that users love.  Prior to my career as a software engineer, I worked for 11 years as a civil/environmental engineer.  I have an MS in <b><i>Computer Science</i></b> from <b><i>UNC-Greensboro</i></b>, as well as an MS in Civil Engineering from <b><i>NC State University</i></b>, and a BS in Biology from <b><i>Duke University</i></b>."
