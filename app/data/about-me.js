const AboutMe = {
    text: 'I am a <b><i>fullstack</i></b> software developer in Greensboro, North Carolina, with a focus on front-end web development.  I have several years of experience building web applications with html, css and javascript (using frameworks/libraries such as Angular.js, React.js, Vue.js and JQuery).  One of the things I love about being a software developer is the open source community and abundance of knowledge sharing through StackOverflow, Github, Twitter, blog posts, video tutorials etc.  I enjoy continually learning and trying new technologies, while not losing focus on the main goal, which is to complete software that is actually used in production.  Whenever possible, I use open-source software.  My favorite tools for building apps include:  VS Code for a development environment, webpack and npm scripts for building and bundling assets,  Postman for testing and documenting API endpoints, MongoDB or Couchbase for document (JSON) storage, MySQL or Postgres for relational databases, foAWS and IBM Bluemix ,  I tend to be product-focused, and love the process of bringing an app idea to life.  Prior to my career as a software engineer, I worked for 11 years as a civil/environmental engineer.  I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science from UNC-Greensboro, as well as a Masters Degree in Civil Engineering from NC State University, and a BS in Biology from Duke University.'

Libraries like Bootstrap and various material design implementations are my friends as a starting point for styling, although customizations are important for a completed and polished product.  When it comes to writing code, I believe the most important thing is that it works, secondly that it is well organized, and finally that it is easy to read and understand (not a fan of clever code for the sake of writing one line instead of three).  I believe in following a pattern that works well over and over because practice and consistency leads to less errors.
