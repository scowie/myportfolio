    text: 'I am a <b><i>fullstack</i></b> software developer in Greensboro, North Carolina.  Most of my development experience is in building web applications with html, css and javascript (using frameworks/libraries such as Angular.js, React.js, Vue.js and JQuery).  I tend to be product-focused, and love the process of bringing an app idea to life.   '

/*
Libraries like Bootstrap and various material design implementations are my friends as a starting point for styling, although customizations are important for a completed and polished product.  When it comes to writing code, I believe the most important thing is that it works, secondly that it is well organized, and finally that it is easy to read and understand (not a fan of clever code for the sake of writing one line instead of three).  I believe in following a pattern that works well over and over because practice and consistency leads to less errors.
