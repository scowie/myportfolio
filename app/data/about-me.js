    text: 'I am a fullstack software developer in Greensboro, NC.  Most of my development experience is in building web applications with html, css and javascript (using frameworks/libraries such as Angular.js, React.js, Vue.js and JQuery).  I love the process of bringing an app idea to life as quickly as possible, and iterating to improve it.  Libraries like Bootstrap and various material design implementations are my friends as a starting point for styling, although customizations are important for a completed and polished product.  When it comes to writing code, I believe the most important thing is that it works, secondly that it is well organized, and finally that it is easy to read and understand (not a fan of clever code for the sake of writing 1 line instead of 3).  I believe in following a pattern that works well over and over because practice and consistency leads to less errors. '
