    text: "I am a <b><i>fullstack</i></b> software developer in Greensboro, North Carolina, with a focus on front-end web development.  I have several years of experience building web applications using javascriipt frameworks/libraries such as <b><i>Angular</i></b>, <b><i>React</i></b>, <b><i>Vue</i></b> and <b><i>JQuery</i></b>.  I enjoy continually learning and trying new technologies, which often make a developer's job faster and easier.  But, it takes more than new tools and technologies to build great software.  I tend to be product-focused, and love the process of bringing an app idea to life, and believe a developer's main goal should be to produce software that users love."
